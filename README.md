## WHY AND WHAT
It is a simple website that allows employees to get new job, and employers to find employees for them to do any task.
## HOW
We created three tables:
1. For employees data
2. For employers data
3. For tasks that employees have.

New users can create new account for them. New users can decide weather they want to sign up as employees or as employers. New employees can add their tasks. Other users can perform searching about any skill and the results will show all uses who already have this skills.
